# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

This webpage is intended to be an altered version of my [previous portfolio](https://michaelfriel.github.io/My-portfolio/), in order to build the page using Bootstrap rather than through raw HTML / CSS.
Key differences and considerations can be found below: 

* General theme of the page is much darker, with a focus on black and white as the primary palette. 
* Used Bootstrap Navbar component to create the navigation. This responds into a burger menu on medium screens and below.
*
